 ## Design
 ### Colour Scheme
 * The colours used in the site were taken from the colours of the inside of Monica Geller's front door 
 * Background colours ......
 * Font colouurs .......

 ### Site Title Colour Scheme
 * The title of the site is 'Friends', with the subtitle of 'The One With All The Questions'.
 * The coloured dots which appear between each letter in the word 'Friends' in the opening credits of the show, are an integral part of the Friends brand. They appear on official merchandise, on DVD covers and on Netflix thumbnails. The colours of the dots match the colours of umbrellas held by the 6 main cast members in the opening credits of the pilot episode (Joey and Chandler hold blue umbrellas, Phoebe and Monica's umbrellas are yellow, and Ross and Rachel each hold a red umbrella). Therefore it was crucial to include them in the title of the website as avid Friends fans will expect to see them.
 * The colours used for the dots were generated by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). I used their [Color Picker tool](https://coolors.co/ffc73f) on a screenshot of the opening credits of an episode of Friends to pick out colours which match those of the original dots as closely as possible (red, blue and yellow).

     </details>

 ### Typography
  * The Font used in the opening credits of 'Friends' is very distinctive and easily recognisable - especially to avid fans of the show. Therefore I knew I needed to use a font as close as possible to the original to make the site appealling to Friends fans. I used [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/) to research which font was the closest match. The results showed that this was Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font. I downloaded this font from [Font Meme](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/gabriel-weiss-friends-font-font/).

          <img src="assets/readme-images/gabriel-weiss-friends-font.png" alt="Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font"> 
     </details>
* the font [Crashbow](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/crashbow-font/) - also from Font Meme, is the first fallback font, in case Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font fails to load correctly. It was selected due to its similarity to Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font.
     <details>
          <summary>Crashbow font</summary>
          <img src="assets/readme-images/crashbow-font.png" alt="Crashbow font"> 
     </details>
* Two further fallback fonts have been set, in case neither Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font or Crashbow load correctly. The second fallback is Cursive, with Serif as the third and final fallback font.

The image was found via a [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/) image search with results set to 'Creative Commons licenses'. This image was then used as the site's logo.
