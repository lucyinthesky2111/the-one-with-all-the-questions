## Frameworks Libraries and Programmes
 ### Creation
  * [Bootstrap version 5.3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) - was used to create the responsive nav bar that appears on all pages, and the image carousel which appears on the site’s About page. I also used the [breakpoints defined by Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) when writing CSS media queries. 
  * [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) – was the initial code editor used.
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) – was the code editor used for the remainder of the project. I changed code editors due to Code Institute’s migration from GitPod to VS Code. 
  *	[Git](https://git-scm.com/) – was used for version control.
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/) – was used to create and store the project repository and create the user stories project board.
  *	[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) – was used to choose and import the fonts used in the site.
  * [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) – was used to choose and import the icons used in the site. 
  * [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) – was used to create the wireframes. 
  * [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) – was used while building the project to test responsiveness, and for debugging.

  ### Testing
  * [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) – was used to validate the HTML.
  *	[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) – was used to validate the CSS.
  *	[WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools](https://wave.webaim.org/) – was used to test the site for accessibility.
  * [Google Chrome Developer Tools (Lighthouse feature)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview) - was used to test the site for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO.

  ### Images
  * [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) – were used to source all the images used in the site. 
  * [Tinify](https://tinypng.com/) – was used to optimise all images.
  * [Design](https://www.design.com/) – the Clutch Kings College logo was customised from a template on Design.
  * [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) – was used to remove the background from the logo, and to crop all images to the desired aspect ratio.
  * [Aspect Ratio Calculator](https://aspectratiocalculator.com/) – was used to pick appropriate aspect ratios for all images used in the site.
  * [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) – was used to generate the site’s favicon.
  * [Techsini](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup/) – was used to generate a mockup of the homepage on various screen sizes.
  * [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) – was used to generate the site’s colour scheme.
  *	[WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) – was used to test all colour combinations for accessibility.

 ### Miscellaneous 
 * [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/) – was used to generate the college’s name and for proof-reading. 

# Testing and Validation
Please refer to [this file](TESTING.md) for details of the testing and validation undertaken.

* Navigate to the right-hand side of the page and click ‘Fork’. This is located in-line with your repository name underneath the nav bar. 
* Give the forked repository a name of your choosing.
* Amend the repository description if required.
* Tick ‘Copy the main branch only'.
*	Click the ‘Create fork’ button.
* You will now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone
