# Responsiveness
 CSS media queries were used to make this website responsive. When writing media queries, I used the same breakpoints as Bootstrap.

Responsivity at the Bootstrap breakpoints, and on different device screen sizes, was tested using Google Chrome Devtools. Device screen sizes tested include:
* iPhone SE
* iPhone XR
* iPhone 12 Pro
* iPhone 14 Pro Max
* Pixel 7
* Samsung Galaxy S8+
* Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
* iPad Mini
* iPad Air
* iPad Pro
* Surface Pro 7
* Surface Duo
* Galaxy Z Fold 5
* Asus Zenbook Fold
* Samsung Galaxy A51/71
* Nest Hub
* Nest Hub Max
* Galaxy Fold

* I personally tested the website on a Samsung Galaxy S22 (See [Resolved Bugs](#resolved) for details), an Asus Tuf Gaming A15 laptop and a Samsung Odyssey G5 34" curved monitor.
