# Introduction
* As someone who has been a fan of Friends since they were a child, I wanted to create a quiz for other people who love the show.     
* The quiz is a timed question and answer game to enable fans to test their knowledge of the show. 
* All the Friends episodes have titles including ‘The One’ e.g. ‘The One with the Football’ etc. In keeping with this tradition, the website has the subtitle of ‘The One with all the Questions’. 
* As an added touch for Friends fans to appreciate, Friends quotes, references, and images relating to the show are placed throughout the site.  

* This is my second milestone project for the Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.

# User Experience
  ## Site Owner Goals
  * For the site to provide an enjoyable, fun and interactive quiz for fans of Friends to test their knowledge of the show. 
  * For the site to be accessible to all fans of Friends by including questions of varying difficulty levels, in order to accommodate all levels of knowledge. 
  * For the site to feature links to the site owner’s social media accounts so users can contact them and find out more about their work. 

  ## Site Manager Goals
  * For the HTML, CSS and JS code to be clear, logical, and contain explanatory comments in order to ensure the site is easy to update and maintain. 
  * For images to be downloaded to the site manager's computer, not hosted by an external site, to ensure images are always available for the user.  

  ## User Stories
  These can be found in my GitHub [project board](https://github.com/users/lucyinthesky2111/projects/9/views/1) for this repository.

  As a player of the game, these are the features I want to see ranked in order of importance:
  
  ### Must Have Features
  * Clear instructions as to how to play the game which are accessible from anywhere on the site (user story 2). 
  * Immediate visual feedback as to whether my answer is correct or incorrect for each question (user story 3). 
  * Facility to see my final score at the end of the game, so I can replay and try to beat it (user story 4). 
  * For there to be questions of varying difficulty levels, so I can participate regardless of my knowledge level (user story 5). 

  ### Should Have Features
  * Visual indication of my progress, showing my current stage of the game (user story 6). 
  * Facility to see my current score throughout the game (user story 7). 

  ### Could Have Features
  * A message along with my final score, which is different according to what score I achieve (user story 8). 
  * A time limit on each question, to add a small amount of pressure, and make the game more challenging and exciting (user story 9). 
  * The questions and possible answers appear in a random order each time I play to increase replay-ability (user story 10). 
  * Ability to filter questions by difficulty level (user story 11). 


## User Expectations and Requirements
* All user story 1 (must-have)
* To find the website easy to access and navigate on any screen size. 
* For the site to be fully accessible. 
* For the site to be engaging and visually appealing, including high quality images which are related to Friends. 
* For any external links to open in a new tab. 
* To find a navigation menu at the top of every page. 
* To find a footer at the bottom of every page. 
* To receive a custom 404 error page which links back to the Homepage, when trying to access an incorrect URL within the site. 


# Features
## Initial Stage Features
I decided that the following features were all ‘must haves’ or ‘should haves’ (refer to the [user stories](https://github.com/users/lucyinthesky2111/projects/9/views/1) for details) at the initial stage to ensure a ‘minimum viable product’.  

* Instructions on how to play. 
* Visual indication of how far the user has progressed through the game.   
* The ability to see whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect immediately after answering. 
* The ability for the user to track their score throughout the game, as opposed to only seeing their score at the end.  
* The ability for the user to also see their final score at the end of the game. 
* For there to be questions of varying difficulty, to allow all fans of Friends to play regardless of their knowledge level. 

I was able to successfully implement all of the initial stage features. 

## Looking at the initial stage features of each part of the project in turn: 

### Navigation Bar
* A responsive navigation bar is included on each page of the site, to allow the user to easily navigate between pages without having to go back to the homepage or rely on the browser forward and back buttons.  
* The nav bar is sticky so it is always visible at the top of the page when the user is scrolling the site. 
* The links on the nav bar are in black text which appear blue when the user hovers over them to maintain readability and accessibility. 
* The 'active' link i.e. the page the user is on, is underlined as a visual reminder. 
* The links on the nav bar appear as a horizontal list on larger screens and in a drop down menu on smaller screens. 
<h2><img src="../readme-images/navbar-mobile.png">Nav bar on mobile and tablet </h2>
<h2><img src="../readme-images/nav-bar-desktop.png">Nav bar on desktop </h2>

 
### Footer
* Each page features a footer which contains a copyright statement, and icons linking to social media pages. 
* Fans of Friends will also recognise the name and address featured in the footer as references from the show. 
* All the social media links open in a new tab.
* The footer is not sticky so it does not restrict the user's view of the bottom of the screen when scrolling.  
* The icons and text are black with an appropriate hover colour of blue to maintain readability and accessibility. 
<h2><img src="../readme-images/footer-mobile.png">Footer (Mobile)</h2>
<h2><img src="../readme-images/footer-desktop.png">Footer (Desktop)</h2>


### Navigation Buttons 
* Navigation buttons are used throughout the site to link to other pages. 
* The buttons are consistent in style and colour across the site. 
* Buttons which sit against a purple background are yellow and buttons which sit against a yellow background are purple to ensure they stand out from the rest of the content.  
* All buttons regardless of their starting colour, change to white when clicked to maintain readability and accessibility.
* The text colour remains black when the button is clicked, to ensure the text remains legible against its background.
<h2><img src="../readme-images/yellow-button-on-purple-background.png">Yellow button on purple background</h2>
<h2><img src="../readme-images/purple-btn-on-yellow-bckgrnd.png">Purple button on yellow background</h2>


### Introduction Modal
* The introduction modal introduces the game using a series of Friends references.  
* The introduction modal is only visible on the Homepage. 
* The modal gives the user the option to either proceed straight to the quiz (if they are a returning user or are confident they know how to play), or to navigate to the Help page where they can view instructions.  
* The introduction modal is displayed when the Homepage loads.
* The user can close the modal by clicking on the ‘X’ button in the top right-hand corner, or by clicking ‘Play’ or ‘Home’ to navigate to one of those pages.  
* Clicking ‘X’ displays the Homepage content which is located behind the modal. This content is described in the next section of this documentation. 
* After closing the modal, the user can access it again by clicking ‘Home’ from the nav bar. 
<h2><img src="../readme-images/intro-modal-mobile.png">Introduction Modal (Mobile)</h2>
<h2><img src="../readme-images/introduction-modal.png">Introduction Modal (Desktop)</h2>


### Homepage
* The Homepage is the site’s landing page.  
* The Homepage features a full-page background image, which fans of the show will recognise as the outside of the famous ‘Central Perk’ coffeehouse. 
 * There is a partially transparent box over the centre of the image containing the site’s title and subtitle, which makes it immediately clear that the site is a quiz about the TV show Friends. 
 * The box border (and all box borders which appear on the site), do not have any border radius applied to them. This is because the Gabriel Weiss’ Friends Font suits stark square edges better than softer, rounder ones. 
 * A box shadow is applied to add texture and a layering effect, to add visual interest to the page, making it more aesthetically pleasing. 
<h2><img src="../readme-images/homepage-mobile.png">Homepage (Mobile)</h2>
<h2><img src="../readme-images/homepage-desktop.png">Homepage (Desktop)</h2>

### Play Page
* The Play Page houses the quiz content. 
* The site’s title and subtitle appear at the top of the page. 
* The centre of the page features a box which houses the quiz content. For consistency, the box has no border radius and has a box shadow, as per the box on the Homepage.  
* At the bottom of the page are 3 images which Friends fans will recognise as relating to the show.  
* Corresponding quotes from 1 of the 6 main characters appear underneath each image on tablet and desktop screens only, to utilise the extra space these screens offer. 
* To prevent clutter and over-crowding on small screens, these quotes are hidden on mobile screens.  
* The remaining background space on this page is intentionally blank to prevent over-whelm and distraction, and to focus the user’s attention on the box which houses the quiz content.  
<h2><img src="../readme-images/play-page-mobile.png">Play Page (Mobile)</h2>
<h2><img src="../readme-images/play-page-desktop.png">Play Page (Desktop)</h2>

### Help Page
* The Help Page features a box containing instructions as to how to play the game. 
* At the top of the box there are 3 images which Friends fans will recognise as relating to the show. 
* Underneath the images is a Friends reference which fans will recognise from an episode where Joey auditions to be the host of a quiz show to introduce the instructions. 
* The instructions are concise and bullet-pointed for easy reading.  
* Underneath the instructions are buttons which the user can use to either begin playing the game, or to navigate to the Homepage. 
<h2><img src="../readme-images/help-page-mobile.png">Help Page (Mobile)</h2>
<h2><img src="../readme-images/help-page-desktop.png">Help Page (Desktop)</h2>

### 404 Error Page
* A custom 404 error page displays if the user tries to access an incorrect URL within the site.  
* This is a simple page which features 3 Friends related images and Friends related references, as well as a button which directs the user back to the homepage. 
* I followed [this guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-siteS) from Github to create the page.  
<h2><img src="../readme-images/404-error.png">404 Page</h2>

## Future Additions
I decided that the following features were ‘could-haves’ - they would be nice to have but were not essential for a ‘minimum viable product’.   
* Displaying a message along with the user’s final score which differs depending on the score they achieve. 
* A time limit imposed on each question. 
* Questions and possible answers appearing in a different random order each time a new game is played. 
* Ability to filter questions by difficulty level. 

Due to time constraints, I have not been able to implement the ability to filter the questions by difficulty level. I have been able implement all other ‘could have’ features. Given that the quiz does contain questions of varying difficultly, I decided that whilst it would be nice for the user to be able to filter those questions according, this did not add as much value to the game as the other ‘could have’ features. Therefore, I chose to prioritise those.  

Some additional features that I would like to implement in the future are: 

* To increase replay-ability of the quiz, I would like to increase the pool of available questions and display only a proportion of these during each game. This would mean that the user could play the game many times over and be asked questions they have not seen before, on each playthrough. 
* To supplement the quiz and add more value for the user, I would like implement a quote generator. This would have options to select a Friends character and view a selection of randomised quotes from them, as well as options to select an episode and receive randomised quotes from that episode.  
* I would also like to add an episode selector feature. The user would be able to select a category (such as birthdays, weddings, Christmas etc) and receive a list of episodes which meet this criteria. The user would also be able to select a mood from a pre-defined list (e.g. I want to cry, I want to feel motivated etc) and receive a list of recommended episodes based on that mood. 
* I have also written all the content for a 6-question ‘which character are you most like' quiz that I would like to add to the site at a later stage.

 # Design

 ## Colour Scheme
 * The colours used in the site were taken from the colours of the back of Monica Geller's front door.
 * The colour scheme was designed using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). I used their [Color Picker tool](https://coolors.co/ffc73f) on an image of the door to pick out the colours of the door itself (tropical indigo - purple), the peephole frame (jonquil - yellow) and the doorknob (metallic gold).
 * All colour combinations were tested for accessibility using [WebAim: Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). 
 * Except for the Homepage which features a full-page background image, the other pages on the site feature coloured boxes placed on a white background. These boxes are either purple or yellow and use the opposite colour for any buttons. The gold colour is used as a border colour around any purple boxes and around the name tag image on the introduction modal. 
 * Jonquil yellow is used as the background colour on both the nav bar and the footer. 
 * An alpha value is applied to jonquil yellow when used as a box colour on the Help and 404 Error pages to distinguish it from the nav bar and footer. 
 * The buttons on the site which sit against a purple background are yellow and buttons which sit against a yellow background are purple to ensure they stand out from the rest of the content. 
 * All buttons regardless of their starting colour, change to white when clicked to maintain readability and accessibility. 
 * Black is used as the font colour, except for the correct and incorrect scores underneath the question and answers box, which are green and red respectively. 
 * The black font is contrasted with blue as the hover colour, to ensure readability and accessibility.

### Site Title Colour Scheme
 * The title of the site is 'Friends', with the subtitle of 'The One with all the Questions'.
 * The coloured dots which appear between each letter in the word 'Friends' in the opening credits of the show, are an integral part of the Friends brand. They appear on official merchandise, on DVD covers and on Netflix thumbnails. The colours of the dots match the colours of umbrellas held by the 6 main cast members in the opening credits. Therefore it was crucial to include the dots in the title of the website as avid Friends fans will expect to see them.
 * The colours used for the dots were generated by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). I used their [Color Picker tool](https://coolors.co/ffc73f) on a screenshot of the opening credits of an episode of Friends to pick out colours which match those of the original dots as closely as possible (red, blue and yellow).
 * In order to maintain accessibility, the colours used for the blue and yellow dots are slightly darker on the play page (where they are against a white background), as using the same colours as used on the homepage, resulted in a contrast error when the page was tested using the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaulation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) and the [WebAim Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) - [see Testing file](TESTING.md) for details. The colour of the red dot presented no contrast errors on a white background, and is therefore left unchanged.

 ## Typography
  * The Font used in the opening credits of 'Friends' is very distinctive and easily recognisable - especially to avid fans of the show. Therefore I knew I needed to use a font as close as possible to the original to make the site appealling to Friends fans. I used [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/) to research which font was the closest match. The results showed that this was Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font. I downloaded this font from [Font Meme](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/gabriel-weiss-friends-font-font/).

          <img src="../readme-images/gabriel-weiss-friends-font.png" alt="Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font"> 
     </details>
* The Gabriel Weiss’ Friends Font is entirely upper case by default. To keep the font authentic, I have not adjusted this. I did, however, notice that the font in its default state, placed the letters quite close to each other, which made it slightly difficult to read. For user convenience and accessibility, I have used CSS to add a small amount of letter spacing to rectify this. 
* The font [Crashbow](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/crashbow-font/) - also from Font Meme, is the first fallback font, in case Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font fails to load correctly. It was selected due to its similarity to Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font.
     <details>
          <summary>Crashbow font</summary>
          <img src="../readme-images/crashbow-font.png" alt="Crashbow font"> 
     </details>
* Two further fallback fonts have been set, in case neither Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font or Crashbow load correctly. The second fallback is Cursive, with Serif as the third and final fallback font.
* I noticed that the Gabriel Weiss Friends Font becomes quite difficult to read when applied to large chunks of text.  
* Friends uses a secondary font for its end credits. I conducted a Google search which identified that font as the font [Lydian](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/lydian-font/). 
* As the Lydian font is easier to read, it has been used on areas of the site which contain a lot of text i.e. the introduction modal, the question and answers box on the Play Page, the final score boxes, the Help Page and the 404 Error Page.
