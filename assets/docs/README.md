# Introduction
* As someone who has been a fan of Friends since they were a child, I wanted to create a quiz for other people who love the show.     
* The quiz is a timed question and answer game to enable fans to test their knowledge of the show. 
* All the Friends episodes have titles including ‘The One’ e.g. ‘The One with the Football’ etc. In keeping with this tradition, the website has the subtitle of ‘The One with all the Questions’. 
* As an added touch for Friends fans to appreciate, Friends quotes, references, and images relating to the show are placed throughout the site.  

* This is my second milestone project for the Code Institute Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.

# User Experience
  ## Site Owner Goals
  * For the site to provide an enjoyable, fun and interactive quiz for fans of Friends to test their knowledge of the show. 
  * For the site to be accessible to all fans of Friends by including questions of varying difficulty levels, in order to accommodate all levels of knowledge. 
  * For the site to feature links to the site owner’s social media accounts so users can contact them and find out more about their work. 

  ## Site Manager Goals
  * For the HTML, CSS and JS code to be clear, logical, and contain explanatory comments in order to ensure the site is easy to update and maintain. 
  * For images to be downloaded to the site manager's computer, not hosted by an external site, to ensure images are always available for the user.  

  ## User Stories
  These can be found in my GitHub [project board](https://github.com/users/lucyinthesky2111/projects/9/views/1) for this repository.

  As a player of the game, these are the features I want to see ranked in order of importance:
  
  ### Must Have Features
  * Clear instructions as to how to play the game which are accessible from anywhere on the site (user story 2). 
  * Immediate visual feedback as to whether my answer is correct or incorrect for each question (user story 3). 
  * Facility to see my final score at the end of the game, so I can replay and try to beat it (user story 4). 
  * For there to be questions of varying difficulty levels, so I can participate regardless of my knowledge level (user story 5). 

  ### Should Have Features
  * Visual indication of my progress, showing my current stage of the game (user story 6). 
  * Facility to see my current score throughout the game (user story 7). 

  ### Could Have Features
  * A message along with my final score, which is different according to what score I achieve (user story 8). 
  * A time limit on each question, to add a small amount of pressure, and make the game more challenging and exciting (user story 9). 
  * The questions and answers appear in a random order each time I play to increase replay -ability (user story 10). 
  * Ability to filter questions by difficulty level (user story 11). 


## User Expectations and Requirements
* All user story 1 (must-have)
* To find the website easy to access and navigate on any screen size. 
* For the site to be fully accessible. 
* For the site to be engaging and visually appealing, including high quality images which are related to Friends. 
* For any external links to open in a new tab. 
* To find a navigation menu at the top of every page. 
* To find a footer at the bottom of every page. 
* To receive a custom 404 error page which links back to the Homepage, when trying to access an incorrect URL within the site. 


# Features
## Initial Stage Features
I decided that the following features were all ‘must haves’ or ‘should haves’ (refer to the [user stories](https://github.com/users/lucyinthesky2111/projects/9/views/1) for details) at the initial stage to ensure a ‘minimum viable product’.  

* Instructions on how to play. 
* Visual indication of how far the user has progressed through the game.   
* The ability to see whether the selected answer is correct or incorrect immediately after answering. 
* The ability for the user to track their score throughout the game, as opposed to only seeing their score at the end.  
* The ability for the user to also see their final score at the end of the game. 
* For there to be questions of varying difficulty, to allow all fans of Friends to play regardless of their knowledge level. 

I was able to successfully implement all of the initial stage features. 

Looking at the initial stage features of each part of the project in turn: 

### Navigation Bar

 
### Footer

### Buttons

### Introduction Modal

### Homepage
* The homepage features a full-page background image, which fans of the show will recognise as the outside of the famous ‘Central Perk’ coffeehouse. 
 * There is a partially transparent box over the centre of the image containing the site’s title and subtitle, which makes it immediately clear that the site is a quiz about the TV show Friends. 
 * The box border (and all box borders which appear on the site), do not have any border radius applied to them. This is because the Gabriel Weiss’ Friends Font suits stark square edges better than softer, rounder ones. 
 * A box shadow is applied to add texture and a layering effect, to add visual interest to the page, making it more aesthetically pleasing. 

### Play Page

### Help Page

### 404 Error Page

 # Design

 ## Colour Scheme
 * The colours used in the site were taken from the colours of the inside of Monica Geller's front door 

### Site Title Colour Scheme
 * The title of the site is 'Friends', with the subtitle of 'The One with all the Questions'.
 * The coloured dots which appear between each letter in the word 'Friends' in the opening credits of the show, are an integral part of the Friends brand. They appear on official merchandise, on DVD covers and on Netflix thumbnails. The colours of the dots match the colours of umbrellas held by the 6 main cast members in the opening credits. Therefore it was crucial to include the dots in the title of the website as avid Friends fans will expect to see them.
 * The colours used for the dots were generated by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). I used their [Color Picker tool](https://coolors.co/ffc73f) on a screenshot of the opening credits of an episode of Friends to pick out colours which match those of the original dots as closely as possible (red, blue and yellow).
 * In order to maintain accessibility, the colours used for the blue and yellow dots are slightly darker on the play page (where they are against a white background), as using the same colours as used on the homepage, resulted in a contrast error when the page was tested using the WAVE ......... (SEE TESTING.MD FOR DETAILS). The colour of the red dot presented no contrast errors on a white background, and is therefore left unchanged.

     </details>

 ## Typography
  * The Font used in the opening credits of 'Friends' is very distinctive and easily recognisable - especially to avid fans of the show. Therefore I knew I needed to use a font as close as possible to the original to make the site appealling to Friends fans. I used [Google](https://www.google.co.uk/) to research which font was the closest match. The results showed that this was Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font. I downloaded this font from [Font Meme](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/gabriel-weiss-friends-font-font/).

     </details>
* The Gabriel Weiss’ Friends Font is entirely upper case by default. To keep the font authentic, I have not adjusted this. I did, however, notice that the font in its default state, placed the letters quite close to each other, which made it slightly difficult to read. For user convenience and accessibility, I have used CSS to add a small amount of letter spacing to rectify this. 
* The font [Crashbow](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/crashbow-font/) - also from Font Meme, is the first fallback font, in case Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font fails to load correctly. It was selected due to its similarity to Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font.

* Two further fallback fonts have been set, in case neither Gabriel Weiss' Friends Font or Crashbow load correctly. The second fallback is Cursive, with Serif as the third and final fallback font.
